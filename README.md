Create a Quiz using AWS Amplify and Cognito (with CI/CD)
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Quiz Application using AWS Amplify and AWS Cognito, integrating CI/CD for seamless deployment. The application is built using React.js, with user authentication handled by Cognito, and hosted on AWS Amplify with automated deployment via GitHub Actions.

Steps to Reproduce
1️⃣ Setup Environment
•	Install Node.js (latest LTS version)
•	Install AWS CLI and configure AWS credentials
•	Install Amplify CLI (npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli)
•	Install React (npx create-react-app my-quiz-app)
2️⃣ Create React App
•	Initialize a new React project
•	Set up basic routing
•	Add necessary dependencies
3️⃣ Add Authentication with AWS Cognito
•	Initialize Amplify (amplify init)
•	Add authentication (amplify add auth)
•	Configure Cognito user pool
•	Push changes (amplify push)
4️⃣ Add Functionality and Build the Quiz
•	Implement the quiz logic
•	Integrate authentication with Cognito
•	Style the UI for a better user experience
5️⃣ Push Code to GitHub
•	Initialize a Git repository (git init)
•	Connect to GitHub (git remote add origin <repo-url>)
•	Push changes (git push origin main)
6️⃣ Host Frontend in AWS Amplify via GitHub (CI/CD)
•	Connect the GitHub repository to AWS Amplify
•	Enable automatic deployments
•	Deploy the application
7️⃣ Merge and Validate Deployment
•	Check if the app is hosted successfully
•	Test authentication and quiz functionality
•	Merge changes and verify CI/CD workflow
